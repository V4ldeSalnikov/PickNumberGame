# PickNumberGame'

Here is my implementation of Pick Number Game.
The Game rules are folowwing:
1) Players generate random array of numbers
2) On each move player can pick either first or last number in array. The number is added to corresponding player sum.
3) When array is empty the user with higher score wins.

To implement this game I used QtWidget and C++
